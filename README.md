# Freelance Project

##### A freelance design development process, September 14-21, 2018

#### By AJ MCgladdery

## Project Description

This project showcases a new co-working startup. The site’s design reflects the physical environment’s unique feel: balancing a luxurious, cool, and high-end feel with a welcoming inclusivity. The site demonstrates the workspace’s commitment to safety, comfort, and productivity. The site also showcases the startup’s funky and local charm, which is different from more sterile, corporate co-working competitors. Another distinction of this startup is its broader clientele, which transcends the tech-world and includes artists, daytraders, craftspeople, writers, counselors, more traditional business people. The site features the start-up’s wide range of amenities. The site includes a landing page, contact page, page featuring amenities, page detailing subscription model/cost/membership/how to join.
